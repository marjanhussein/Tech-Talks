I had the priviledge to be invited as a speaker during the Umma University GDSC Info session.

As a reknown speaker and an Impactful community advocate, I got the opportunity to share insights to Umma university computer science students.

I shared about the GDSC program and it's impact on the students careers. I highlighted the importance of having that program as apart of their learning hubs and shared testimonials from my own school.
