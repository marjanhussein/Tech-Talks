Why not have an event at the Micorosft ADC and bring together Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors from all over Kenya?
MLSA is not just a name, but an imprtant identity. It started by just a random thought and now it is an annual event.

In 2023, I hosted this event at the Microsoft ADC office and had the priviledge of being supported by the Ecosystem lead Irene Githinji
and the Managing Director, Catherine Muraga! It was an event dream come true.

The meet up brought together 50+ student ambassadors from all over Kenya and we discussed the major issues that we are facing as ambassadors and how we can solve them
or rather how can the Microsoft ADC come in and support us.

It was all a success and I received appreciation from multiple people saying how they really needed the meetup.
