I had the privilege of hosting MLSA Unite 2023, an incredible event that brought together Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors from all over Kenya. During the event, Catherine Muraga, the Managing Director, sparked a meaningful conversation around the gender ratio in Kenyan universities, specifically in computer-related courses.

This discussion resonated deeply with many ambassadors, as we shared our own experiences. 
In most classrooms, the ratio of female to male students is strikingly uneven—often around 9:60.
In my own class, studying Computer Technology, there are only 9 women out of 60 students.

That powerful discussion inspired the creation of the ADC WINS (Africa Development Center, Women Inspiring and Nurturing Students) program, aimed at supporting and encouraging female students in tech.

On International Women’s Day 2024, I was honored to be invited by Microsoft ADC to lead an open mic session. 
I began by sharing my personal story to help set a comfortable tone for others to open up. What followed was a truly meaningful conversation, with women sharing their experiences, the challenges they’ve faced, and how they overcame them. Students sought advice from professionals on navigating the challenges of being a woman in tech. It was a powerful, productive session that fostered connection and support among the attendees.
