I hosted the MLSA Unite 2023, one of a kind event that brought together Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador from all over Kenya.
During the event, the Managing Director, Catherine Muraga, brought up the discussion around the ratio of female students to male students in kenyan universities specifically computer related courses.
This spiked a meaningful conversation among ambassadors , where most of them argued that in a typical classrom, the ratio of female students to male students is 9:60.
In my case, we are a class of 60 students (My major is in Computer Technology). Out of the 60, only 9 of us are females and the rest are men.
With that being Discussed, it brought the birth of ADC WINS program. It stands for Africa Development Center, Women Inspiring and Nurturing students.
During the 2024 International Women's day, I got invited by Microsoft ADC to lead an open Mic session. I started by sharing my personal story so as to let the ladies read the room and open up.
We ended up having people opening up and sharing the challenges they have faced and how they solved them, or students asking professional how to deal with this or that.
It was a productive session!
