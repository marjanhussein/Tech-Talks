Just like Google I/O Extended Nairobi Student Edition, I hosted the DevFest Nairobi Student Edition on October 2023.

Due to my competency in hosting the Google I/O one, my manager entrusted me to this one.

You guessed it right, I did an amazing job. This onw was larger and more impactful.

The event brought together 500 Students from all over the Nairobi region and 25+ GDSC leads from all over Kenya.

It highlighted the use of Google technologies for developers and the results were amazing.

We had the program manager, John Kimani give the keynote address and also Khadija Juma the Current GDG on Campus program manager share a keynote address.

Here is the link to the event videos and report.
