Microsoft ADC, in collaboration with Microsoft Research Africa, hosted an event that brought together university lecturers from across Kenya. I had the honor of being invited by Microsoft ADC to serve as a student representative during the panel discussion.

During the session, I shared my perspective on the evolving role of AI as an assistant in students' everyday learning. I highlighted how tools like Azure can be used to work with our own data. For example, we can upload several PDFs, including past papers, and ask AI questions based on those documents. The system then provides answers drawn from the uploaded data, streamlining the learning process.

I also introduced GitHub Copilot, an AI programming assistant, and explained how it helps students refine their programming skills by suggesting code, offering solutions, and enhancing productivity in real time.
