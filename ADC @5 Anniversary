Hey there, this was an anniversary by Microsoft ADC East Africa celebrating their 5 years since the launch.
Being a very active student ambassador, I got invited to be a panelist!
I shared about my experience as a student ambassador and the impact I had made in my local community.
Also, I shared about the ADC WINS Program, a program by the Microsoft ADC that supports 70 female university students by pairing them with mentors from Microsoft.
I shared a personal story about a time I faced stereotyping while leading my computer club at the university and how ADC WINS program helped me counter that.
The corporate vice president, Igor sakhnov was present. He was impressed by the story I gave and encouraged me to keep pushing harder.
