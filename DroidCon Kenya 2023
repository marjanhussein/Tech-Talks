DroidCon Kenya is one of the largest Adnroid Developers COnference in Kenya!

I had the priviledge of being a speaker in on of the sessions and my talk was about MediaPipe: Making machine learning a piece of Pie!

I shared a lot more about MediaPipe, a technology by Google. During my hands on lab session, we built a machine learning model and integrated Media pipe library.

That hard cording it. But what's more interesting is there is MediaPipe Studio, where you can play around with its capabilities including hand gestures recognition, facial recognition
object detection, hand landmark recognition and so on! Try it!
