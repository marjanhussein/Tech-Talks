This was July 2023 and I decided to awaken the giant within me.

I was a Google Developer Student Club lead at the Multimedia University of Kenya, on the record, a very active one.

Google I/O is an annual event by Google that brings together developers that build on Google Technologies. After the main event happens, active google community led events happen all over the world.

So I approached my manager and asked if I could host the Google I/O Extended Nairobi Student Edition, now only focusing on students developers.

He agreed and that's how I hosted, together with other GDSC leads, the biggest student led Google I/O Extended Student Edition event in the whole Sub Saharan Region!
I brought together 250+ students from all over Nairobi and 25+ GDSC Leads. The event highlighted Google Technologies including Angular, Firebase, Google Cloud, Tensorflow and Keras.

Hope you enjoy!
